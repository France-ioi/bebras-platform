    "help_content": "            <b>Creation of groups </b>             <p>             The contest system is based on the creation of student groups. This helps to reduce the amount of information you need to provide before the contest. (You declare groups, rather than every student.) This also reduces the number of contest access codes - one per group.             </p><p>             To prepare for the contest in your school:             </p><p>             <b>1. Make a list of \"groups\" your school needs. </b>             </p><p>             A \"group\" consists of students being entered at the same level and participating in the contest at the same time.             For example, if you want all the students from class 6e to enter in the same hour, that's a group. If you want to have half of the class of 6e on one day (same hour) and another on a different day that would mean two groups. Students from different classes in the 6th grade participating during the same hour, that's one group. If you want some students from the 6th grade and some students from 4th grade to participate at the same time, that's two groups.             </p><p>             <b>2. In the GROUP tab, create your groups : declare the name, level, participation date, and the size of each group.</b>             </p>             <p>             <i>When creating groups, you don't need to provide the names of students.

It is therefore important to create at least as many groups as participation sessions.</p></li>              <li><p>A <b>secret code</b> <u>for the teacher's use only</u> who will supervise the group during the contest.<br/>             <b>Warning:</b> It will be needed by the teacher in the rare case when a student is interrupted in the middle of the contest.</p></li></ul>             </div>             <p>             <b>3.
